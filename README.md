Rollbar Logback
=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tapstream/rollbar-logback.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tapstream/rollbar-logback)

This is a fork of the Tapstream's [Rollbar Logback Appender](https://github.com/tapstream/rollbar-logback) created on
June 10th, 2016 for use with the error aggregation service [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com/). You will need a Rollbar
account: sign up for an account [here](https://rollbar.com/signup/).


Logback
------------

	<Rollbar name="rollbar" apikey="[YOUR APIKEY HERE]" environment="dev" system="laundry">
        <apiKey></apiKey>
        <environment>local</environment>
    </Rollbar>

	<root level="debug">
		<appender-ref ref="rollbar"/>
	</root>

Appender parameters:

* url: The Rollbar API url. Default: https://api.rollbar.com/api/1/item/
* apiKey: The rollbar API key. The API key is mandatory and has to be set either here or
  [via an environment variable](#providing-the-api-key-externally).
* environment: Environment. i.e. production, test, development. Mandatory.


Providing the API key externally
---------------------------------------

You can choose to set the API key by using an environment variable. This way your API key stays out of your code and
your source control repository.

Create the environment variable `ROLLBAR_LOGBACK_API_KEY` and set its value to your API key. This value will
override the value set in `logback.xml` (if set).


Custom MDC parameters
----------------------

Any MDC values with keys that do not start with `RollbarFilter.REQUEST_PREFIX` will be added as custom parameters to
the Rollbar item request.


Servlet Filter
---------------

Located at `com.tapstream.rollbar.logback.RollbarFilter` is a J2EE servlet filter that will populate the `request`
portion of the Rollbar item from a ServletRequest. The filter will include:

* Remote IP address
* User agent
* Method
* URL
* Query String
* Headers
* Parameters
